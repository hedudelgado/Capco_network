”This is no time to take your chips down. A million dollars isn’t cool, you know what’s cool?"  
>”You?"  
>”A social network implemented in Java"
​
Implement a console-based social networking application (similar to Twitter) with the features below.
​
### Features:
​
**User creating**: a new user called *Spike* can be created  
**Posting**: *Spike* can publish messages to a personal timeline  
**Reading**: *Spike* can view *Nikesh’s* timeline  
**Following**: *Leo* can subscribe to *Spike* and *Nikesh's* timelines, and view an aggregated list of all subscriptions  
​
Instructions:
​
* please provide a solution in Java, as a GitHub link to Spike (on Slack) by 10am Monday
* submitted is better than complete (aka shipped is better than perfect)
* we are more interested in your design, approach and progress with Java than whether you manage to create a fully working command line app
​
For tools, we recommend: Intelli-J as an IDE, JUnit for testing and Mockito for mocks (if you choose to mock)
​
Good luck!
